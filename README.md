A python script that takes in a CSV file containing a timeline of processes scheduled on a single processor.
The output is a Gantt chart, for ease of data visualization.

The CSV file contains rows in this format:
  process identity number, priority for CPU scheduling, start, duration, end

This script was written as an optional add on to a CSCI-350 [Operating Systems] homework assignment for coding a CPU scheduler.
